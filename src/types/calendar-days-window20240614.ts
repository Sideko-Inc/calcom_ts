   *       Determines the behavior of the booking window:
   *       - If **true**, the window is rolling. This means the number of available days will always be equal the specified 'value'
   *         and adjust dynamically as bookings are made. For example, if 'value' is 3 and availability is only on Mondays,
   *         a booker attempting to schedule on November 10 will see slots on November 11, 18, and 25. As one of these days
   *         becomes fully booked, a new day (e.g., December 2) will open up to ensure 3 available days are always visible.
   *       - If **false**, the window is fixed. This means the booking window only considers the next 'value' days from the
   *         moment someone is trying to book. For example, if 'value' is 3, availability is only on Mondays, and the current
   *         date is November 10, the booker will only see slots on November 11 because the window is restricted to the next
   *         3 calendar days (November 10–12).
